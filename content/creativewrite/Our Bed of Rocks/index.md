## The poem 

The physical manifestation of feelings on a journey from rock bottom to the ahcieved reality of a dream.


---------------------------------------
Someday, we'll climb on top of roofs \
and look down the chimneys \
remembering our bed of rocks


Someday, we'll reach for the skies\
and look down at the roofs \
remembering our fear of heights


Someday, we'll reach for the moon \
and point to the Earth \
remembering our winding roads


Someday, we'll reach for the stars \
and look back at our planets \
remembering our Earth, \
its winding roads, \
its high roofs,\
its bed of rocks

------------------------------------
## Commentary

This piece is pretty simple but it means a lot to me. I wrote it about two years ago and it has become some sort of mantra for myself. Initially, I've published it for friends and family on social media, then I published it under a fake name on a writing website (so if you see it there, lol dw that's me), and now I'm finally starting to publish things here. I've been fairly private about my writing in the past even though its a craft that I started practicing regularly as a child, so perhaps this is the start of a new era, where I'm publishing under my real name.

I experiment a lot with my writing and for the most part, my pieces are more about exploration rather than targeted entertainment. Some experiments succeed and some don't but I love the exploratory process and I simply want to share something I love here. I will write and have written for entertainment, but I'll make the distinction clear between experiments and actual pieces.


This particular poem was a fairly conscious experiment in what I call metaphorical "spatial shifting". That is, building an abstract metaphor structure that allows me to have concrete metaphors in that larger structure where the reader is shifted smoothly from one place to another with each place representing something meaningful in the larger structure.
