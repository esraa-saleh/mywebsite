## Overview

In the following list, is a compilaton of papers on scientific methoodology and best practices in Machine Learning with a special focus on Reinforcement Learning sometimes. The intention is to create a strong starting point for folks who are interested in ensuring rigour in their experiments. The list was compiled with help from amazing folks in the RLAI lab.
