Scientific research is often framed within paradigms of concepts, definitions, axioms, and assumptions â€” RL is no exception. While such details usually go unchallenged in the pursuit of specific objectives, this workshop brings them into sharp focus. In this workshop, we examine the conceptual foundations of RL and their impact on framing problems. We are excited for this workshop, because we believe it has the potential to open up new territory, test our historical beliefs, and ultimately guide our future research endeavors in productive directions. Overall, we hope to generate enthusiasm and build a community dedicated to examining the conceptual foundations of RL.

This is a full-day workshop. The first half of the day features four short talks, representing different perspectives on RL. Following these talks, these speakers join a panel discussion. Using this panel as backdrop for the rest of the day, we open the floor to submitted work, which includes poster sessions and lightning talks.
