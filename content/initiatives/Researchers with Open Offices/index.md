[Researchers with Open Offices](https://esraasaleh.notion.site/Researchers-with-Open-Offices-27dd8febd78d42b9ad4627f3525f28fe?pvs=4) is a live list of any researchers that I encounter and who explicitly say they're open to people reaching out for research or career chats (or something similar).

I believe in a future of research where people communicate, share experiences and collaborate no matter what their location might be in the world. This felt like a small step towards enabling that, especially after I started noticing that researchers were offering this sort of thing on their websites but people often did not know about them.
